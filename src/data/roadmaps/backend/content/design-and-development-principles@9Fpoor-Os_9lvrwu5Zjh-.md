# Design and Development Principles

Design and Development Principles are fundamental guidelines that inform the creation of software systems. Key principles include:

1. SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
5. Separation of Concerns
6. Modularity
7. Encapsulation
8. Composition over Inheritance
9. Loose Coupling and High Cohesion
10. Principle of Least Astonishment

These principles aim to create more maintainable, scalable, and robust software. They encourage clean code, promote reusability, reduce complexity, and enhance flexibility. While not rigid rules, these principles guide developers in making design decisions that lead to better software architecture and easier long-term maintenance. Applying these principles helps in creating systems that are easier to understand, modify, and extend over time.
