# Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool that enables users to manage multiple Docker nodes and deploy services across them. It is a native clustering and orchestration feature built into the Docker Engine, which allows you to create and manage a swarm of Docker nodes, referred to as a _Swarm_.

## Advantages

- **Scalability**: Docker Swarm allows you to scale services horizontally by easily increasing or decreasing the number of replicas.

- **Load balancing**: Swarm ensures that the nodes within the swarm evenly handle container workloads by providing internal load balancing.

- **Service discovery**: Docker Swarm allows you to automatically discover other services in the swarm by assigning a unique DNS entry to each service.

- **Rolling updates**: Swarm enables you to perform rolling updates with near-zero downtime, easing the process of deploying new versions of your applications.
