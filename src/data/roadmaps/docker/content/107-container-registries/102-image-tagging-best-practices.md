# Image Tagging Best Practices

Properly tagging your Docker images is crucial for efficient container management and deployment. In this section, we will discuss some best practices for image tagging.

## Use Semantic Versioning

When tagging your image, it is recommended to follow Semantic Versioning guidelines. Semantic versioning is a widely recognized method that can help better maintain your application. Docker image tags should have the following structure `<major_version>.<minor_version>.<patch>`. Example: `3.2.1`.

## Tag the Latest Version

Docker allows you to tag an image as 'latest' in addition to a version number. It is a common practice to tag the most recent stable version of your image as 'latest' so that users can quickly access it without having to specify a version number. However, it is important to keep this tag updated as the new versions are released.

```sh
docker build -t your-username/app-name:latest .
```

## Use Automated Build and Tagging Tools

Consider using CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Travis-CI) to automate image builds and tagging based on commits, branches, or other rules. This ensures consistency and reduces the likelihood of errors caused by manual intervention.
