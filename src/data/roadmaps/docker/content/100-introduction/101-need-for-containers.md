# Need for Containers

In the world of software development and deployment, consistency and efficiency are crucial. Before containers came into the picture, developers often faced challenges when deploying applications across different environments including:

- **Inconsistent environments:** Developers often work in different environments which might have different configurations and libraries compared to production servers. This leads to compatibility issues in deploying applications.

- **Inefficient resource utilization:** Virtual Machines (VMs) were widely used to overcome environment inconsistency. However, VMs require an entire OS to be running for each application, making the resource utilization inefficient.

- **Slow processes and scalability issues:** Traditional deployment methods have a slower time to market and scaling difficulties, which hinders fast delivery of software updates.
