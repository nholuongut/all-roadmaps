# Container Security

- Container security is a critical aspect of implementing and managing container technologies like Docker. It encompasses a set of practices, tools, and technologies designed to protect containerized applications and the infrastructure they run on.

- Isolation is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of containerized environments. Containers should be isolated from each other and the host system, to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the potential damage in case an attacker manages to compromise one container.

- Implementing best practices and specific security patterns during the development, deployment, and operation of containers is essential to maintaining a secure environment.

- Access controls should be applied to both container management and container data, in order to protect sensitive information and maintain the overall security posture.

- Containers can be vulnerable to attacks, as their images depend on a variety of packages and libraries. To mitigate these risks, vulnerability management should be included in the container lifecycle.
