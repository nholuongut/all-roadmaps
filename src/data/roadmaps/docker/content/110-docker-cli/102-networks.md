# Docker Networks

Docker networks provide an essential way of managing container communication. It allows containers to talk to each other and to the host machine using various network drivers. By understanding and utilizing different types of network drivers, you can design container networks to accommodate specific scenarios or application requirements.

## Managing Docker Networks

Docker CLI provides various commands to manage the networks. Here are a few useful commands:

- List all networks: `docker network ls`
- Inspect a network: `docker network inspect <network_name>`
- Create a new network: `docker network create --driver <driver_type> <network_name>`
- Connect containers to a network: `docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>`
- Disconnect containers from a network: `docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>`
- Remove a network: `docker network rm <network_name>`
