# Containers

Containers can be thought of as lightweight, stand-alone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, ensuring that it works uniformly across different environments.

## Working with Containers using Docker CLI

Docker CLI offers several commands to help you create, manage, and interact with containers. Some common commands include:

- `docker run`: Used to create and start a new container.

- `docker container ls`: Lists running containers.

- `docker container stop`: Stops a running container.

- `docker container rm`: Removes a stopped container.

- `docker exec`: Executes a command inside a running container.

- `docker logs`: Fetches the logs of a container, useful for debugging issues.
