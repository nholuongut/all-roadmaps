# Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. They allow you to separate the data from the container itself, making it easy to backup, migrate, and manage your persistent data.

## Types of Volumes

There are three types of volumes in Docker:

- **Host Volumes**
- **Anonymous Volumes**
- **Named Volumes**

## Volume Management with Docker CLI

Docker CLI provides various commands to manage volumes:

- `docker volume create`: Creates a new volume with a given name.
- `docker volume ls`: Lists all volumes on the system.
- `docker volume inspect`: Provides detailed information about a specific volume.
- `docker volume rm`: Removes a volume.
- `docker volume prune`: Removes all unused volumes.

To use a volume in a container, you can use the `-v` or `--volume` flag during the `docker run` command. For example:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-container -v my-named-volume:/var/lib/data my-image
```
